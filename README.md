## Configuration

### GITHUB_TOKEN

Generate a new [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) without any special permissions,
and set this as the value for the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable.

This will reduce the likelihood of rate-limiting by GitHub's API.

## Roadmap

- [x] automatically build and publish for new git tags
